.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcml\-check\-all\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIlinux-source-dir\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBcml\-check\-all\fR is a wrapper which can be used to run \fBcml\-check\fR
over multiple architecture config trees and summarize the result.  By default,
it runs \fBcml\-check\fR with the maximal useful set of warnings over all
the arch trees found in the given \fIlinux-source-dir\fR, then once in merge
mode, and provides a summary at verbosity level 0 (see \fBcml\-summarize\fR(1)
for a discussion of verbosity levels).
.PP
\fBcml\-check\-all\fR options are standard GNU long form and unless otherwise
stated those that take arguments may be used both with and without an = sign,
for example \fB\-\-no\-arch 386\fR or \fB\-\-no\-arch=386\fR.

\fB\-\-help\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
