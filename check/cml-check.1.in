.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcml\-check\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIconfig.in\fR

\fBcml\-check\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIconfig.in\fR \fIconfig.in\fR...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBcml\-check\fR is a correctness checker for the Linux kernel's
configuration rulebase language, variously known as CML1 or just
"config language".  It uses the same CML1 parser backend as the other
GCML2 programs, but emits errors and warnings instead instead of interacting
with the user.  Used in conjunction with \fBcml\-summarise\fR it can
provide a concise summary of the health of a Linux source tree's rules corpus.
.PP
\fBcml\-check\fR operates in one of two modes, single mode and merge mode.
In single mode, \fBcml\-check\fR reads a tree of config files rooted at
a single \fIconfig.in\fR file.  In merge mode, \fBcml\-check\fR reads a
number of potentially overlapping trees of config files, each rooted at
a separate \fIconfig.in\fR file, and internally merges them into a single
tree.  This mode is useful for detecting problems which cannot be seen
without a global view of all arch trees, e.g. symbols not defined in any
arch tree.  Merge mode is entered automatically when more than one filename
is given on the command line, as in the second synopsis.  Merge mode affects
the behaviour of the parser in various ways, e.g. the default set of
enabled warnings.
.PP
The \fBcml\-check\fR interface is deliberately designed to
be comfortable to \fBgcc\fR users.  Warnings are enabled with
\fB-W\fIwhatever\fR and disabled with \fB-Wno-\fIwhatever\fR.
Output is a set of error and warning lines designed to look as much
as possible like \fBgcc\fR messages.  This allows \fBcml\-check\fR
to be conveniently used with tools designed to parse the output of
\fBmake\fR runs, such as \fBmaketool\fR and \fBemacs\fR's \fIM-x compile\fR
command.
.PP
All other options are standard GNU long form and those that take arguments
may be used both with and without an = sign, for example \fB\-\-arch 386\fR
or \fB\-\-arch=386\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display a summary of usage and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-arch\fR \fIarch\fR
Specify the value of the \fI$ARCH\fR variable used during parsing.
This no longer has much practical effect.
.TP
\fB\-\-xref\fR \fIfilename\fR
Specify a filename to which config symbol cross-reference information
will be written.  The file will contain a sequence of records, one per
text line, describing the location and type of each definition or use
of a config symbol in the CML1 corpus.
.TP
\fB\-\-W\fIwarning\-name\fR
Enable the warning named \fIwarning\-name\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-Wno-\fIwarning\-name\fR
Disable the warning named \fIwarning\-name\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-Wall\fR
Enable all warnings, even those not useful in \fBcml\-check\fR's current
mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-Wno-all\fR
Disable all warnings.

.SH WARNINGS
.PP
The following warnings are reported by \fBcml\-check\fR.  The headings
are warning names emitted by the \fBcml\-summarize\fR program and can
be used with the \fB\-W\fR option.  Unless otherwise noted, the examples
are real CML1 rules taken from the Linux 2.5 series.

.SH ERRORS
.PP
The following errors are reported by \fBcml\-check\fR.
Note that the names used as headings below are not used in any
\fBcml\-check\fR options but do correspond to the names emitted by the
\fBcml\-summarize\fR script.
