.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcml\-check\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIconfig.in\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBcml\-check\fR is a correctness checker for the Linux kernel's
configuration rulebase language, variously known as CML1 or just
"config language".  It uses the same CML1 parser backend as the other
GCML2 programs, but emits errors and warnings instead instead of interacting
with the user.  Used in conjunction with \fBcml\-summarise\fR it can
provide a concise summary of the health of a Linux source tree's rules corpus.
.PP
\fBcml\-check\fR operates in one of two modes, single mode and merge mode.
In single mode, \fBcml\-check\fR reads a tree of config files rooted at
a single \fIconfig.in\fR file.  In merge mode, \fBcml\-check\fR reads a
number of potentially overlapping trees of config files, each rooted at
a separate \fIconfig.in\fR file, and internally merges them into a single
tree.  This mode is useful for detecting problems which cannot be seen
without a global view of all arch trees, e.g. symbols not defined in any
arch tree.  Merge mode is entered automatically when more than one filename
is given on the command line, as in the second synopsis.  Merge mode affects
the behaviour of the parser in various ways, e.g. the default set of
enabled warnings.
.PP
The \fBcml\-check\fR interface is deliberately designed to
be comfortable to \fBgcc\fR users.  Warnings are enabled with
\fB-W\fIwhatever\fR and disabled with \fB-Wno-\fIwhatever\fR.
Output is a set of error and warning lines designed to look as much
as possible like \fBgcc\fR messages.  This allows \fBcml\-check\fR
to be conveniently used with tools designed to parse the output of
\fBmake\fR runs, such as \fBmaketool\fR and \fBemacs\fR's \fIM-x compile\fR
command.
.PP
All other options are standard GNU long form and those that take arguments
may be used both with and without an = sign, for example \fB\-\-arch 386\fR
or \fB\-\-arch=386\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display a summary of usage and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-arch\fR \fIarch\fR
Specify the value of the \fI$ARCH\fR variable used during parsing.
This no longer has much practical effect.
.TP
\fB\-\-xref\fR \fIfilename\fR
Specify a filename to which config symbol cross-reference information
will be written.  The file will contain a sequence of records, one per
text line, describing the location and type of each definition or use
of a config symbol in the CML1 corpus.
.TP
\fB\-\-W\fIwarning\-name\fR
Enable the warning named \fIwarning\-name\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-Wno-\fIwarning\-name\fR
Disable the warning named \fIwarning\-name\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-Wall\fR
Enable all warnings, even those not useful in \fBcml\-check\fR's current
mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-Wno-all\fR
Disable all warnings.

.SH WARNINGS
.PP
The following warnings are reported by \fBcml\-check\fR.  The headings
are warning names emitted by the \fBcml\-summarize\fR program and can
be used with the \fB\-W\fR option.  Unless otherwise noted, the examples
are real CML1 rules taken from the Linux 2.5 series.

A symbol depends on <span class="code">CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL\fP but does
not tell the user in it's banner using the <span class="code">(EXPERIMENTAL)\fP
tag\.  This is confusing to the user, who expects the tag to correspond to
reality\.  The large number of these is due to whole menu subtrees being
sourced inside <span class="code">if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]\fP\.
For example,

the user\.  For example,

A symbol is defined in two locations\. or is included from two locations,
one of which depends on <span class="code">CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL\fP and
one of which doesn't\.  This makes it impossible to decide whether to put
an <span class="code">(EXPERIMENTAL)\fP tag in the banner or not\.
Note that despite the name, the check is based on the actual condition and
dependencies of the definitions, and the tag is ignored\.  For example,

A symbol is defined in two locations\. or is included from two locations,
one of which depends on <span class="code">CONFIG_OBSOLETE\fP and

Symbol references or tristate constants appearing after
the last valid argument in a <span class="keyword">bool\fP or
<span class="keyword">tristate\fP statement,
either because someone thought they were using
<span class="keyword">dep_bool\fP
or because they thought that <span class="keyword">bool\fP takes
a default value argument like <span class="keyword">hex\fP and
<span class="keyword">string\fP\.  For example,

     "foo    " foo
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="nonliteral\-define">
.in -4m
\fBnonliteral\-define\fP
.br
.in +4m
A <span class="keyword">define\fP statement defines a symbol to an
expression which is more than just a literal value like "y" or "n"\.  This
is not actually part of the config language, but has crept in
because it works for some configurators\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
define_bool CONFIG_JBD \fB$CONFIG_EXT3_FS\fP
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="unset\-statement">
.in -4m
\fBunset\-statement\fP
.br
.in +4m
The <span class="keyword">unset\fP statement was used\.  There may be
nothing inherently wrong with that statement, I just haven't entirely
figured out why people have used it and how to check it for problems\.


<a name="different\-banner">
.in -4m
\fBdifferent\-banner\fP
.br
.in +4m
A symbol was defined multiple times in different arch trees
or in different branches of <span class="keyword">if\fP statements
with different banner strings\.  A very small number of these could
arguably be justified; the vast majority are just trivial textual
differences which don't affect meaning\.  Such cases make harder the job
of merging architecture\-dependent rules\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
# arch/mips/config\.in
bool 'Support non\-SCSI/IDE/ATAPI \fBCDROM\fP drives' CONFIG_CD_NO_IDESCSI

# arch/alpha/config\.in
bool 'Support non\-SCSI/IDE/ATAPI drives' CONFIG_CD_NO_IDESCSI
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="different\-parent">
.in -4m
\fBdifferent\-parent\fP
.br
.in +4m
A symbol was defined multiple times in different arch trees
or in different branches of <span class="keyword">if\fP statements
in a different menu\.  Usually this is because a symbol is being
defined in one menu and queried in another\.  Such constructs generally
work fine in <span class="code">config\fP and sometimes in
<span class="code">menuconfig\fP but lead to strange presentation
problems in <span class="code">xconfig\fP\.  This warning also
catches genuine mistakes, for example:

<pre class="example">
# arch/ia64/config\.in
mainmenu_option next_comment
comment 'Processor type and features'
\&\.\.\.
bool '    Enable DEVFS Debug Code' \fBCONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG\fP n

# fs/Config\.in
mainmenu_option next_comment
comment 'File systems'
\&\.\.\.
dep_bool '  Debug devfs' \fBCONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG\fP $CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="overlapping\-definitions">
.in -4m
\fBoverlapping\-definitions\fP
.br
.in +4m
A symbol was defined multiple times in different branches of
<span class="keyword">if\fP statements where there exist combinations
of symbol settings which result in two of these branches being
visible at the same time\.  This causes presentation problems in all
three configurators\.  The warning also includes the trivial case
of a symbol defined twice\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
if [ "$CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL" != "n" ]; then
   \.\.\.
   bool '  Spinlock debugging' \fBCONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK\fP
   \.\.\.
   bool '  Spinlock debugging' \fBCONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK\fP
fi
\fR
.in -4m

<a name="overlapping\-mixed\-definitions">
.in -4m
\fBoverlapping\-mixed\-definitions\fP
.br
.in +4m
Like the <a href="#overlapping\-definitions">overlapping\-definitions\fP
warning, but the symbol is defined as a query (e\.g\.
<span class="keyword">bool\fP) in one branch and a define
(e\.g\. <span class="keyword">define_bool\fP) in another\.
Depending on a number of factors, this can cause symptoms ranging
from presentation problems to inconsistent configs, in all three
configurators\.  This warning is usually more serious than the plain
<a href="#overlapping\-definitions">overlapping\-definitions\fP warning\.
For example,

<pre class="example">
bool 'Support non\-SCSI/IDE/ATAPI CDROM drives' \fBCONFIG_CD_NO_IDESCSI\fP
\&\.\.\.
if [ "$CONFIG_VIOCD" = "y" ]; then
   define_bool \fBCONFIG_CD_NO_IDESCSI\fP y
fi
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="primitive\-in\-root">
.in -4m
\fBprimitive\-in\-root\fP
.br
.in +4m
A query symbol, rather than a sub\-menu, was present in the root menu\.  This
breaks <span class="code">xconfig\fP\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
# arch/mips/config\.in
source drivers/pci/Config\.in

# drivers/pci/Config\.in
if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]; then
   \fBbool\fP 'PCI device name database' CONFIG_PCI_NAMES
fi
\fR
.in -4m



<a name="undeclared\-symbol">
.in -4m
\fBundeclared\-symbol\fP
.br
.in +4m
A symbol was used in an expression but never declared and the symbol is
given an empty default value\.  Note that in merge mode this warning
becomes an error\.  In single mode the usual culprit is a symbol defined
only in another arch tree; use merge mode to find symbols not declared in
any architecture\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
if [ "\fB$CONFIG_405\fP" = "y" ]; then
   \.\.\.
fi
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="forward\-compared\-to\-n">
.in -4m
\fBforward\-compared\-to\-n\fP
.br
.in +4m
A symbol was used in an <span class="keyword">if\fP statement
of the form <span class="code">if [ "$CONFIG_FOO" != "n" ]\fP, 
where CONFIG_FOO has not been defined with a query or a
<span class="keyword">define_*\fP statement\.  This can be
because the symbol is defined in another arch tree, or is defined
after this use (see <a href="#forward\-reference">forward\-reference\fP),
or is never defined (see <a href="#undeclared\-symbol">undeclared\-symbol\fP)\.
Under some circumstances (e\.g\. <span class="code">make allyesconfig\fP) the
symbol will have an empty value at this point and the comparison will
not do what the rules author thought it did\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
# arch/mips/config\.in
source drivers/parport/Config\.in

if [ "$CONFIG_DECSTATION" = "y" ]; then
   \.\.\.
   tristate 'Standard/generic (dumb) serial support' CONFIG_SERIAL

<a name="symbol\-arch">

\fBsymbol\-arch\fP
.br
.in +4m
The undocumented symbol <span class="code">$ARCH\fP was used in a rule\.
This symbol, along with all the user's environment variables, is available
to the shell\-based configurators <span class="code">config\fP and
<span class="code">menuconfig\fP and happens to work in
<span class="code">xconfig\fP, but is not a documented part of
the config language\.  For example,

<pre class="example">

   define_bool CONFIG_OSF_PARTITION y
fi
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="forward\-reference">

A symbol was used (for example, in a condition or a dependency for a
<span class="keyword">dep_bool\fP) before it was declared\.  Note that
this warning does not count symbols used but never declared (see
<a href="#undeclared\-symbol">undeclared\-symbol\fP)\.  This
indicates poor menu design which uses a symbol before it is declared
elsewhere in the menu structure, thus making life difficult for users of
<span class="code">make config\fP and
<span class="code">make allyesconfig\fP\.  For example,
	
<pre class="example">
mainmenu_option next_comment
comment 'Power management options (ACPI, APM)'

if [ "\fB$CONFIG_PCI\fP" = "y" ]; then
  define_bool CONFIG_ACPI_PCI		y

A symbol was used as a dependency for a <span class="keyword">dep_bool\fP,
<span class="keyword">dep_mbool\fP or
<span class="keyword">dep_tristate\fP statement before it was declared\.
Note that this warning does not count symbols used as dependencies but never
declared (see <a href="#undeclared\-dependency">undeclared\-dependency\fP)\.
This indicates poor menu design which uses a symbol before it is declared
elsewhere in the menu structure, thus making life difficult for users of
<span class="code">make allyesconfig\fP\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
# arch/mips/config\.in

A symbol was used as a dependency for a <span class="keyword">dep_bool\fP,

<span class="keyword">dep_tristate\fP statement but was never declared\.
Note that this warning does not count symbols used as dependencies and then
later declared (see <a href="#forward\-dependency">forward\-dependency\fP)\.
In single mode, this warning represents a dependency on a symbol not defined
in the given architecture, which may be a logic error\.  In merge mode, this
warning represents a harmless and pointless fossil which has no effect on
logic but wastes space in the corpus\.  For example,

<pre class="example">
# most of the arches do this
source drivers/ide/Config\.in
\&\.\.\.

\fBsymbol\-like literal\fP

A string literal looks suspiciously like it might have been intended
to be a symbol reference, but the $ character was left off\.  This
may cause logic errors in all configurators\.  For example,

A symbol which the parser considers to be a per\-architecture constant
(e\.g\. <span class="code">CONFIG_X86\fP) is declared in a strange
way, e\.g\. as query rather than a define, or with a type other than bool,
or defined to a value other than "y"\.  This is really just an internal
consistency check for the parser\.  This is not a real example:

a <span class="keyword">dep_bool\fP, <span class="keyword">dep_mbool\fP,
or <span class="keyword">dep_tristate\fP statement\.  These symbols 
have the property that their value is either empty or "y", neither of
which values have an effect as a dependency\.  So the usage is at best
pointless and is probably not what the rule author intended\.

<pre class="example">

The config language is not shell\.




Generally, these constructs will work in <span class="code">config\fP and
<span class="code">menuconfig\fP but fail in <span class="code">xconfig\fP
because <span class="code">xconfig\fP does not use the shell as a parser\.
Sometimes however, they will work in <span class="code">xconfig\fP too as
<span class="code">xconfig\fP sometimes ignores trailing tokens on a line\.
For example,


<pre class="example">
if [ "$CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN1" = "y" \fB] || [\fP "$CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN2" = "y" ]; then
	\.\.\.
fi
\fR
.in -4m

<a name="missing\-file">
.in -4m
\fBmissing\-file\fP
.br
.in +4m
A CML1 filename was included with the <span class="keyword">source\fP
statement but the file could not be opened\.  Usually this is the result
of an arch tree being only partly merged into the mainline kernel\.  For
example,

<pre class="example">
if [ "$CONFIG_SH_DREAMCAST" = "y" ]; then
   source \fBdrivers/maple/Config\.in\fP
fi
\fR
.in -4m


<a name="different\-compound\-type">
.in -4m
\fBdifferent\-compound\-type\fP
.br
.in +4m
A compound node (menu, <span class="keyword">choice\fP or
<span class="keyword">comment\fP statement) uses the same banner as
another compound node of a different type\.  This confuses the parser,
which tries to merge the two nodes\.  Note that
<span class="keyword">comment\fP statements are considered compound 
because of CML2, where comments were implemented as childless menus\.
Sometimes this error indicates a harmless duplication of comments\.
For example,

<pre class="example">
# net/ax25/Config\.in
\fBmainmenu_option\fP next_comment
comment \fB'AX\.25 network device drivers'\fP

source drivers/net/hamradio/Config\.in

endmenu

# drivers/net/hamradio/Config\.in
\fBcomment 'AX\.25 network device drivers'\fP

\fR
.in -4m
