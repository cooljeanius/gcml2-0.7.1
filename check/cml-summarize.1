.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBcml\-summarize\fR summarizes the output of \fBcml\-check\fR
to provide a concise listing of errors and warnings.  Each message
is shown as a simple name, e.g. \fIundeclared\-symbol\fR, which 
for warnings is exactly the name used with the \fB\-W\fR option
to \fBcml\-check\fR.
.PP
\fBcml\-summarize\fR operates at one of three verbosity levels
0 through 2, with 0 being the default.  More information is provided
as the verbosity level increases.  Use the \fB\-\-verbose\fR option
to change the verbosity level.
.TP
Verbosity 0
Shows warning name and count of instances of that error or warning.
.TP
Verbosity 1
Shows the same information as verbosity 0, plus for each warning a
breakdown of which symbols are associated with the error or warning.
.TP
Verbosity 2
Shows the same information as verbosity 1, plus the symbol breakdown
also includes the config.in file location of each instance of the 
error or warning.
.PP
\fBcml\-summarize\fR accepts the following options.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display a summary of usage and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
display the version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR=\fIlevel\fR
The first form increments verbosity level by one, the second form sets the
verbosity level to the given number.  All levels greater than 2 are treated
the same as level 2.
