%description
GCML2 is an alternate configuration system for the Linux kernel.
It supports both the existing CML1 rulebase syntax and Eric S Raymond's
new CML2 language.  It features a strict separation between rulebase
engine and user facing frontends, and strong correctness checking
features.

This package provides the simple front end program and the rulebase
checker.
